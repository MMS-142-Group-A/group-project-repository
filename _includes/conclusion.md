		  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		 <br>
<p>The term Disruptive Technology may seem quite negative, but it is only a different process and perspective on innovation to have an opportunity to keep up with the technology already offered by providing the needs of the customer and the market more cheaply and conveniently, which can make drastic changes.</p>
				  
<p>As an innovation,  E-commerce has slowly reshaped transactions, businesses, and industries. It made things easier, from a consumer's time management to an entire business's plan of operation. Even our country, the Philippines, has seen progress and development in e-commerce. Although for many years, it is already existing, its attributes are just recently appreciated and are more evident due to the tremendous changes it makes in society. Now, E-commerce is part of how people do transactions. From that, E-commerce truly suits the category of Disruptive technology. </p>
