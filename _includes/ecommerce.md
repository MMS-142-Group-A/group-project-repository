                <p class="text-faded">
                E-commerce uses ICT to support a business' external relationships and interactions with people, organizations, and other businesses. According to Kütz (2016), mobile commerce, electronic funds transfers, internet marketing, online transaction processing, and automated data collection systems are just a handful of the technologies utilized in e-commerce. Most E-commerce uses the internet for at least one phase of the transaction's life cycle. To simplify, customers visit a website or online store and make purchases using electronic payments. The merchant sends the products or renders the service after receiving the payment. (Fuscaldo, 2022)

                According to Bloomenthal, the types of E-Commerce can be distinguished by the parties that interact through E-Commerce. Each of these has its usage; some are more prominent than others.

                            This is the most common type of business model. B2C E-commerce means that the companies sell directly to the end-user. Amazon is an example of B2C as it sells its products on its  E-commerce website. Another is through the use of their website, such as Linus Tech Tip’s store.

                            B2B E-commerce is the transaction of businesses to other businesses. An example would be sourcing products from manufacturers to wholesalers, such as selling shoes from a factory to a shop on an online platform. Nike and Adidas have their brand on online platforms such as Amazon may be an example of B2B.

                                As a buyer, it's worth noting that the quality of a product may vary among shops. The goods you may purchase might be damaged en route to your location or the product is simply of poor quality. There is no sure way of knowing if the product is good outside of ratings and reviews from other E-commerce users.

                                Business platforms could be hacked, which is the harsh reality of online commerce. Customers want assurance that their financial information won't be shared or compromised when they make an online purchase and want to feel secure doing so. Businesses and organizations are targets of malicious hackers who take customer information from their databases. Not only does this undermine the trust in the company, but it may also have financial and legal repercussions.

                                People and relationships play a large part in business. Because there are fewer face-to-face interactions in the E-commerce world, developing those relationships can be more difficult.
